Module 14 Challenge

The purpose of this interactive dashboard is to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The sections of this dashboard include:

1. a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

2.  a bubble chart that displays each sample.

otu_ids for the x values.

sample_values for the y values.

sample_values for the marker size.

otu_ids for the marker colors.

otu_labels for the text values.

3. Sample metadata of demographic information. Displays each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
